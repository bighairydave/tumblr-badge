tumblr-badge
============

For embedding Tumblr feeds in a webpage.

1. Take Robert Nyman's [tumblr badge script](http://robertnyman.com/2008/09/19/tumblrbadge-a-tumblr-badge-script/).
2. Add Neale Dutton's code for [adding titles](http://blog.ndutton.co.uk/post/448630534/tumblr-badge).
3. Hack up the dates a bit so they're not clickable.
4. Add a conditional statement so that titles are only added to text posts.


Note: [this](http://coulson84.tumblr.com/post/27486410046/tumblr-js-api) is most likely a better solution.
